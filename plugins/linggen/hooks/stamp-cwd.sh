# PreToolUse hook installed by the linggen plugin. Stamps where the session
# stands onto every memory call — the facts a host knows and a model would
# only copy by hand (ling-mem doc/scope-index-spec.md):
#
#   memory_add           cwd (the row's default scope), root (what a model's
#                        `scope` resolves against), source_session, host
#   memory_search        scope_root = root (recall: rows under the root, at
#                        its parents, and about the person)
#   memory_session_start cwd, root
#
# The daemon owns the rules — which dirs can hold rows, which a root sees —
# so this hook only hands it paths. `root` is the SESSION's root (scope.sh
# session_root), not the shell cwd's: the candidates were shown against it. The model picks a row's `scope` from the
# candidates the SessionStart hook showed; the daemon checks it against
# `root` and falls back to `cwd`.
#
# WHY A HOOK AND NOT THE MODEL. These are facts about the session, not
# judgments about the content. The store's own history is the argument — when
# writes moved from the CLI (which had `--cwd`) to MCP (which did not), `cwd`
# fell to 7 rows out of 1142, and `source_session`, which used to be asked of
# the model every turn, sat at 44%. Anything mechanical belongs here.
#
# CLAUDE CODE ONLY, and not by choice: Codex's hook runner fires PreToolUse
# for shell tools only and REJECTS `updatedInput` (openai/codex#18491), so
# there is no seam between the model and the daemon there. On Codex the
# per-turn recall is still scoped — recall.sh sends `scope_root` itself — but
# the model's own memory calls go unstamped. When Codex ships input rewrite,
# add the PreToolUse matcher to codex.hooks.json and this script serves both
# hosts unchanged.
#
# Bails silently on anything unexpected — a memory write must never fail
# because attribution could not be worked out.
